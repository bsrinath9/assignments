Your report is an important part of this assignment. I have not provided a template, but I expect your report to include your name, CS625-HW4, date, and appropriate headings and Markdown markup for clarity and neatness. In addition, you will lose points if there are many spelling or grammatical errors. 

Your report must include images of your recreated charts and a description of how you created the chart in the tool of your choice. Include enough detail to help someone trying to recreate your chart. You must also include an assessment of how close you were able to recreate each chart.
