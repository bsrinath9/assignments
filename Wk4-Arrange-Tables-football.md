# Arrange Tables In-Class Exercises - College Football edition

The goal of this exercise is to gain experience thinking about data types and proposing chart idioms appropriate for that data.
 
## Instructions
* Gather into groups of 2-3 students
* Given the following sets of data, propose idioms that could be used to answer the associated questions/tasks.  Justify your choices for each by listing
  * data items and marks used to encode those data items
  * data attributes, their data types, and the channels used to encode those attributes
* Sketch what the chart might look like (you don't have to include exact data points)
* Take a picture of the sketch and post to the appropriate thread in Piazza. Make sure to indicate who your group members were. 
  * There will be one thread for each question and all threads will be tagged with `wk4-exercise`. 
  * You are encouraged to comment and ask questions about your classmates' submissions.

## Exercise

### Part A
Les Miles was the head coach at LSU between 2005-2016.  This year (2019) he is now the head coach at Kansas.  For the following questions, since the season is still in progress, ignore any data from 2019.  Also ignore his partial year at LSU (he was fired before the 2016 season had completed).

Coaching Record for Les Miles, data at https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/les-miles-1.html

1) What was the trend of Les Miles' winning percentage over his coaching career?

2) In how many years was Les Miles' winning percentage for that year greater than his overall average winning percentage?

3) Compare Les Miles' winning percentage each year between 2005-2015 with that of Nick Saban during that same time period.  Nick Saban  was LSU's head coach before Les Miles and then in 2007 became the head coach at Alabama.  Saban's coaching data is at https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/nick-saban-1.html. 

### Part B
Team Offense, data at https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2018-team-offense.html

1) Compare the passing yards per game for the 20 teams with the highest average passing yards.

2) For the 20 teams with the highest average passing yards, how do their passing yards compare to their rushing yards?

### Part C
Rankings and Team Offense, data at https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2018-team-offense.html and https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2018-standings.html

1) For the 25 teams with the highest winning percentage, is there a correlation between their winning percentage and total yards offense per game, total turnovers per game, passing yards per game, or rushing yards per game?
