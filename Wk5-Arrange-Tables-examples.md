## Pie Chart

Benefits of pie charts:   
* When you see a pie, you immediately have an understanding that it depicts a "whole"
* Pies can be sliced into pieces of that whole.
* It's also very easy for us to pick out a very large slice or a very small slice.

What not to do with pie charts:  
* Don't use 3D effects or explode your pie. 
* If the pie is depicting percents, it must sum to 100%. 
* Don't have a ton of slices. 
* Don't use a pie if the primary goal is to compare the size of the slices.
* Don't use multiple pies and ask your audience to compare across them. 

## Stacked Bar Chart

### 100% Stacked Bar Chart

From https://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=2239

When multiple 100% stacked bars appear in a graph, they only provide information about the parts of some whole, never about the wholes and how they differ.

*Compare the 100% stacked bar chart and multiple line chart shown in the article*

(According to Few) 100% stacked bar graphs are only useful in three specific situations:  
* When the bars consist of only two segments (e.g., male and female)
* When we need to compare the sum of multiple parts among multiple bars
* When we need to compare the percentages of responses to Likert scales
