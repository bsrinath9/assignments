# Data Transformations in R In-Class Exercises

The goal of this exercise is to gain experience using the [dplyr package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8) in R to transform data. This is in preparation for performing EDA and HW6. All of these exercises come from [Chapter 5 (Data Transformations)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) in [*R from Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)
 
**Instructions:** Gather into groups of 2-3 students and work together to answer the following questions.  We will discuss the answers in class.

## Exercise

### filter()

Exercises from [Chapter 5.2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#exercises-7)

Q1: Find all flights that...

Q2: What does `between()` do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

### arrange()

Exercises from [Chapter 5.3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#exercises-8)

Q1: How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start? 

Q2: Sort `flights` to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.

Q3: Sort `flights` to find the fastest flights.

Q4: Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?

### select()

1. (*not from [Chapter 5.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#exercises-9)*) Use ```select()``` in conjunction with ```arrange()``` to sort by the shortest flight (as above) and move the distance column to the first position. This can be in two commands -- we'll look at using pipes later.

### mutate()

Exercises from [Chapter 5.5](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#exercises-10)

Q1: Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because theyâ€™re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

Q2: Compare `air_time` with `arr_time - dep_time`. What do you expect to see? What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?
